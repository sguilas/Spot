# Spot_Workout_Logger_CS184_Project
This is the repository for my CS 184 Term Project called SPOT.
This application is my term project for my Mobile Device Programming class.
I decided to make this app because I've always struggled with keeping track of my workouts while I'm at the gym,
and I don't want to have to bring a notebook.
Switching between the notes app, and a timer app also very frustrating, so I wanted to make something that will handle both.
This class wanted us to make a mobile app using Flutter and Dart since you make an app that is compatible with iOS, Android and Web.
