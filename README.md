# Spot_Workout_Logger

This is the repository for my CS 184 Term Project called SPOT.

This application is my term project for my Mobile Device Programming class.

I decided to make this app because I've always struggled with keeping track of my workouts while I'm at the gym,
and I did't want to have to bring a notebook.

Switching between the notes app, and a timer app was also very frustrating, so I wanted to make something that will handle both.

The app uses Flutter/DART to amke the frontend portion. This was decided because it allowws the app to be compatible with iOS, Android, and Web. I will be 
using Firebase as backend. The database will be used to store custom workouts for the user. 

Right now there are no plans to release this to any app store.
